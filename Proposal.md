**CS 257.00 Project Proposal**

**Nathan Zhang, Emma Yao, Nora Wootten, Aaron Banse**

**Working Title:** 

**Topic:** Nutrition Information In Recipes

**Description:** Using one of the below data sets, this website will allow users to input recipe information (including ingredients and quantities) and output the associated nutritional information for these ingredients. The user input will either be entered using individual input boxes (per ingredient), or one large input location. The website will create a recipe summary for the nutritional information, as well as provide individual ingredient feedback.

**Data Sets:** 

- **Summary:**
  - This database contains data for various types of foods. This includes the amounts of different vitamins and minerals found in different foods as well as macronutrient percentages.

- **User Interaction:**
  - For users seeking to better understand the contents of their recipe, users can paste in a list of ingredients and their amounts and it will return relevant nutritional values. The output will highlight any nutrients that are present in relatively high amounts, without showing every nutrient amount associated with the ingredient.
    - This website could be useful to people looking to meet certain dietary requirements
    - The main feature of the website associated with this interaction will be the input field, in which users can paste their data
    - The main benefit to users is that our website will lower the time spent searching for individual ingredients. People are busy, and often eating well is hampered by our busy schedules. Our website can make it easier for users to make informed nutritional decisions.
    - Based on how the data is processed by the website for users, some users may be seeking specific nutritional information that isn’t included in the website output. For example, some users may be seeking foods high in a certain supplement (such as iron, or manganese, etc.), and not all of these will be included in the output (due to relevance to the majority of users). This may exclude some users from acquiring the desired information they seek from our website.
  - For users interested in eating healthier, our website could be used to compare multiple recipes for the same meal. If a user knows what they would like to cook, and the quantity that they would like to consume, our website can compare which recipe is “healthier” based on ingredient breakdown.
    - This website can be used for people who are craving specific foods but want the healthiest option
    - We will have two input bars that will be used for each recipe as the main feature of our website.
    - By outputting the healthiest recipe, this website will benefit the user by choosing a recipe that will keep them on track for their health goals.
    - Our website hinges on the assumption that users are trying to “eat healthier” or watch what they eat. This assumption builds on and feeds into our society’s obsession with “diet culture,” which could lead to an unhealthy relationship with food.
  - Scale the recipe to hit a set value like calories or protein. Our website returns the new recipe with appropriately scaled ingredient counts. 
    - Based on this feature, the website will also draw users who are seeking to hit certain nutrient goals (those trying to lose or gain weight or muscle, athletes, etc.)
    - Another main feature of the website associated with this interaction is a slider that can adjust the calorie content, protein, etc. (1 at a time)
    - People can customize their portion size based on their specific nutritional needs
    - Again, this feature runs a similar risk of feeding into “diet culture,” which could lead to an unhealthy obsession with portion sizes, or another form of disordered eating.
