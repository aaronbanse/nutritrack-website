- **Meetings**
  - Time, Location, Duration:
    - The team plans to meet after dinner until 9:00 PM, however often as necessary. Our primary meeting location will be Sayles, but as we are familiar with each other, we can also meet in our individual living locations if necessary.
  - Roles:
    - Based on our individual strengths, we will likely fall into a natural working rhythm based on our comfort in group work. 
      - For example, suppose a team member’s natural strength is organizing. In that case, they might fall into a role that relies more heavily on organizational skills, such as setting up meetings, taking notes, etc. 
    - We also want to grow as team members, thus, we will take on various roles to gain individual experience with all aspects of the project. If one team member is always the one taking notes, we will recognize this and adjust accordingly to let someone else practice this skill.
  - Communication and Maintaining Respectful Communication: 
    - We plan to primarily communicate through an iMessage group chat.
    - We already have experience working together in a team environment in which we rely on each other heavily (the swim team), so we are not too worried about maintaining a respectful environment. However, to ensure that communication remains respectful we will raise concerns whenever we have them, and seek advice from our resources/a trusted impartial opinion if we feel communication is trending towards disrespect.
    - For us, respectful communication is communication that listens to all opinions, meets all needs and maintains a productive and safe team environment.
    - We expect each team member to communicate as much as they need to for our goals to be accomplished. This will vary from person to person and week to week.
    - If a teammate is not communicating, we will voice these concerns in person when we get the chance, because often it is unintentional. If the issues are still not resolved, we will communicate our concerns to Jean.
  - Technologies:
    - We will try to prioritize meeting in person, as it is easiest to communicate and work face-to-face. However, if our schedules are too demanding to find time together for a given project, we will use Zoom and/or Facetime if necessary for the team member(s) who are unavailable.
  - Decision-Making:
    - If any disagreement occurs, we will make a decision based on a majority vote.
      - Each team member is expected to cooperate no matter the decision.
    - If possible, we will try to find some form of compromise that satisfies as many group members as possible.
  - Delegation:
    - Everyone will be assigned a portion of the code to work on and we can have group meetings to go over problems and/or progress.
    - We will make sure that everyone is assigned an important piece of the project, as well as a piece of the project that they are excited to work on.
      - Not every piece of code that we write will be interesting/exciting to each member of the group, but we will make an effort for everyone to write some code that they would like to.
  - Expectations:
    - Attend all team meetings in person when possible, otherwise attend via technology. 
      - If we can not find a time that works for everyone, we plan to split into groups of two to work based on our scheduling and communicate beforehand the tasks that each mini-group needs to accomplish.
    - Complete assigned role according to specifications.
    - Work for the betterment of the team.
  - Conflict Resolution
    - To resolve conflict, we will begin by meeting as a group to discuss the problem. We will try to have a productive, meaningful, and effective discussion, however, if this method does not work, we will seek other resources. This might include Jean, friends, or others who might understand the situation or be able to assist in conflict resolution.
